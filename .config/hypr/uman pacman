[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Yay is a Pacman wrapper with AUR support. It passes options to Makepkg and Pacman after
       resolving packages to install/upgrade.

       This manpage only covers options unique to Yay. For other options see [1mpacman(8)[22m.

[1mYAY OPERATIONS[0m
       [1m-Y, --yay[0m
              Perform  yay  specific operations. This is the default if no other operation is selected
              and targets are defined.

       [1m-B, --build[0m
              Build a PKGBUILD in a given directory.

       [1m-P, --show[0m
              Perform yay specific print operations.

       [1m-G, --getpkgbuild[0m
              Downloads PKGBUILD  from  ABS  or  AUR.  The  ABS  can  only  be  used  for  Arch  Linux
              repositories.

       [1m-W, --web[0m
              Web related operations such as voting for AUR packages.

       If no operation is specified 'yay -Syu' will be performed

       If no operation is specified and targets are provided -Y will be assumed

[1mEXTENDED PACMAN OPERATIONS[0m
       [1m-S, -Si, -Sl, -Ss, -Su, -Sc, -Qu[0m
              These operations are extended to support both AUR and repo packages.

       [1m-Sc    [22mYay  will  also  clean cached AUR package and any untracked Files in the cache. Cleaning
              untracked files will wipe any downloaded sources or built packages but will keep already
              downloaded vcs sources.

       [1m-R     [22mYay will also remove cached data about devel packages.

[1mNEW OPTIONS[0m
       [1m-N, --repo[0m
              Assume all targets are from the repositories. Additionally Actions  such  as  sysupgrade
              will only act on repository packages.

       [1m-a, --aur[0m
              Assume  all  targets are from the AUR. Additionally Actions such as sysupgrade will only
              act on AUR packages.

              Note that dependency resolving will still act normally and include repository packages.

[1mYAY OPTIONS (APPLY TO -Y AND --YAY)[0m
       [1m<NO OPTION>[0m
              Displays a list of packages matching the search terms and  prompts  the  user  on  which
              packages to install (yogurt mode).

              The  first  search  term is used to query the different sources and the following search
              terms are used to narrow the search results through exact matching.

       [1m--gendb[0m
              Generate development package database. Tracks the latest  commit  for  each  development
              package,  when  there  is a new commit Yay will know to update. This is done per package
              whenever a package is synced. This option should only be used when migrating to Yay from
              another AUR helper.

       [1m-c, --clean[0m
              Remove unneeded dependencies.

       [1m-cc    [22mRemove unneeded dependencies,  including  packages  optionally  required  by  any  other
              package.

[1mSHOW OPTIONS (APPLY TO -P AND --show)[0m
       [1m-c, --complete[0m
              Print  a  list  of  all  AUR  and repo packages. This allows shell completion and is not
              intended to be used directly by the user.

       [1m-d, --defaultconfig[0m
              Print default yay configuration.

       [1m-g, --currentconfig[0m
              Print current yay configuration.

       [1m-s, --stats[0m
              Displays information about installed packages and system health. If there are  orphaned,
              or  out-of-date  packages, or packages that no longer exist on the AUR; warnings will be
              displayed.

       [1m-w, --news[0m
              Print new news from the Archlinux homepage. News is considered new if it is  newer  than
              the build date of all native packages. Pass this twice to show all available news.

       [1m-q, --quiet[0m
              Only show titles when printing news.

[1mBUILD OPTIONS (APPLY TO -B AND --build)[0m

       [1m-f, --force[0m
              Force  download  for  ABS  packages  that  already  exist in the current directory. This
              ensures directories are not accidentally overwritten.

       [1m-p, --print[0m
              Prints the PKGBUILD of the given packages to stdout.

[1mWEB OPTIONS (APPLY TO -W AND --web)[0m
       Web related operations such as voting for AUR packages.
              Requires setting AUR_USERNAME and AUR_PASSWORD environment variables.

       [1m-u, --unvote[0m
              Remove vote from AUR package(s)

       [1m-v, --vote[0m
              Vote for AUR package(s)

[1mPERMANENT CONFIGURATION SETTINGS[0m
       [1m--save [22mCauses the following options to be saved back to the config file. This provides an  easy
              way to change config options without directly editing the file.

              when deciding if Yay should skip builds.

       [1m--editor <command>[0m
              Editor to use when editing PKGBUILDs. If this is not set the [1mVISUAL [22menvironment variable
              will  be  checked, followed by [1mEDITOR[22m. If none of these are set Yay will prompt the user
              for an editor.

       [1m--editorflags <flags>[0m
              Passes arguments to the editor. These flags get  passed  to  every  instance  where  the
              editor  is  called  by Yay. Arguments are split on whitespace before being passed to the
              editor. Multiple arguments may be passed by supplying a space  separated  list  that  is
              quoted by the shell.

       [1m--makepkg <command>[0m
              The  command to use for [1mmakepkg [22mcalls. This can be a command in [1mPATH [22mor an absolute path
              to the file.

       [1m--pacman <command>[0m
              The command to use for [1mpacman [22mcalls. This can be a command in [1mPATH [22mor an  absolute  path
              to the file.

       [1m--tar <command>[0m
              The  command  to use for [1mbsdtar [22mcalls. This can be a command in [1mPATH [22mor an absolute path
              to the file.

       [1m--git <command>[0m
              The command to use for [1mgit [22mcalls. This can be a command in [1mPATH [22mor an absolute  path  to
              the file.

       [1m--gpg <command>[0m
              The  command  to use for [1mgpg [22mcalls. This can be a command in [1mPATH [22mor an absolute path to
              the file.

       [1m--config <file>[0m

       [1m--requestsplitn <number>[0m
              The maximum amount of packages to request per AUR  query.  The  higher  the  number  the
              faster AUR requests will be. Requesting too many packages in one AUR query will cause an
              error.  This  should  only  make a noticeable difference with very large requests (>500)
              packages.

       [1m--completioninterval <days>[0m
              Time in days to refresh the completion cache. Setting this to 0 will cause the cache  to
              be  refreshed  every  time,  while  setting  this to -1 will cause the cache to never be
              refreshed.

       [1m--sortby <votes|popularity|id|baseid|name|base|submitted|modified>[0m
              Sort AUR results by a specific field during search.

       [1m--searchby <name|name-[0m
       [1mdesc|maintainer|depends|checkdepends|makedepends|optdepends|provides|conflicts|replaces|groups|keywords|comaintainers>[0m
              Search for AUR packages by querying the specified field.

       [1m--answerclean <All|None|Installed|NotInstalled|...>[0m
              Set a predetermined answer for the clean build menu question. This answer will  be  used
              instead of reading from standard input but will be parsed exactly the same.

       [1m--answerdiff <All|None|Installed|NotInstalled|...>[0m
              Set  a  predetermined  answer  for the edit diff menu question. This answer will be used
              instead of reading from standard input but will be parsed exactly the same.

       [1m--answeredit <All|None|Installed|NotInstalled|...>[0m
              Set a predetermined answer for the edit pkgbuild menu question. This answer will be used
              instead of reading from standard input but will be parsed exactly the same.

       [1m--answerupgrade <Repo|^Repo|None|...>[0m
              Set a predetermined answer for the upgrade menu question. Selects which  package  ranges
              or  repos to omit for updates. This answer will be used instead of reading from standard
              input but will be treated exactly the same.

       [1m--noanswerclean[0m
              Unset the answer for the clean build menu.

       [1m--noanswerdiff[0m

       [1m--noansweredit[0m
              Unset the answer for the edit pkgbuild menu.

       [1m--noanswerupgrade[0m
              Unset the answer for the upgrade menu.

       [1m--cleanmenu[0m
              Show the clean menu. This menu gives you the chance to fully delete the downloaded build
              files from Yay's cache before redownloading a fresh copy.

              If 'cleanmenu' is enabled in the configuration file, you can temporarily disable  it  by
              using '--cleanmenu=false' on the command line

       [1m--diffmenu[0m
              Show the diff menu. This menu gives you the option to view diffs from build files before
              building.

              Diffs  are  shown via [1mgit diff [22mwhich uses less by default. This behaviour can be changed
              via git's config, the [1m$GIT_PAGER [22mor [1m$PAGER [22menvironment variables.

       [1m--editmenu[0m
              Show the edit menu. This menu gives you the option to  edit  or  view  PKGBUILDs  before
              building.

              [1mWarning[22m:  Yay  resolves dependencies ahead of time via the RPC. It is not recommended to
              edit pkgbuild variables unless you know what you are doing.

       [1m--askremovemake[0m
              Ask to remove makedepends after installing packages.

       [1m--askyesremovemake[0m
              Ask to remove makedepends after installing packages(with "Y" as default).

       [1m--removemake[0m
              Remove makedepends after installing packages.

       [1m--noremovemake[0m
              Do not remove makedepends after installing packages.

       [1m--topdown[0m
              Display repository packages first and then AUR packages.

       [1m--bottomup[0m
              Show AUR packages first and then repository packages.

       [1m--singlelineresults[0m
              Override pacman's usual double-line search result format and list each result on its own
              line.

       [1m--doublelineresults[0m
              Follow pacman's double-line search result format and list each result using two lines.

       [1m--devel[0m
              During sysupgrade also check AUR development packages for updates.  Currently  only  Git
              packages are supported.

              Devel  checking  is done using [1mgit ls-remote[22m. The newest commit hash is compared against
              the hash at install time. This allows devel updates to be checked almost  instantly  and
              not require the original pkgbuild to be downloaded.

              The  slower  pacaur-like  devel  checks  can be implemented manually by piping a list of
              packages into yay (see [1mexamples[22m).

              If 'devel' is enabled in the configuration file, you can temporarily disable it by using
              '--devel=false' on the command line

       [1m--cleanafter[0m
              Remove untracked files after installation.

              Untracked files are removed with the exception of directories.  This allows VCS packages
              to easily pull an update instead of having to reclone the entire repo.

       [1m--keepsrc[0m
              Keep pkg/ and src/ after building packages

       [1m--timeupdate[0m
              During sysupgrade also compare the build time of installed  packages  against  the  last
              modification time of each package's AUR page.

       [1m--separatesources[0m
              Separate query results by source, AUR and sync

       [1m--redownload[0m
              Always download pkgbuilds of targets even when a copy is available in cache.

       [1m--redownloadall[0m
              Always download pkgbuilds of all AUR packages even when a copy is available in cache.

       [1m--noredownload[0m
              When  downloading pkgbuilds if the pkgbuild is found in cache and is equal or newer than
              the AUR's version use that instead of downloading a new one.

       [1m--provides[0m
              Look for matching providers when searching for AUR packages. When multiple providers are
              found a menu will appear prompting you to pick one. This  increases  dependency  resolve
              time although this should not be noticeable.

       [1m--pgpfetch[0m
              Prompt to import unknown PGP keys from the [1mvalidpgpkeys [22mfield of each PKGBUILD.

       [1m--useask[0m
              Use  pacman's --ask flag to automatically confirm package conflicts. Yay lists conflicts
              ahead of time. It is possible that Yay does not detect a conflict, causing a package  to
              be removed without the user's confirmation.  However, this is very unlikely.

       [1m--combinedupgrade[0m
              During sysupgrade, Yay will first perform a refresh, then show its combined menu of repo
              and AUR packages that will be upgraded. Then after reviewing the pkgbuilds, the repo and
              AUR upgrade will start with no need for manual intervention.

              If  Yay  exits for any reason After the refresh without upgrading. It is then the user's
              responsibility to either resolve the reason Yay  exited  or  run  a  sysupgrade  through
              pacman directly.

       [1m--batchinstall[0m
              When  building  and  installing  AUR  packages  instead of installing each package after
              building, queue each package for install. Then once either all packages are built  or  a
              package  in  the build queue is needed as a dependency to build another package, install
              all the packages in the install queue.

       [1m--rebuild[0m
              Always build target packages even when a copy is available in cache.

       [1m--rebuildall[0m
              Always build all AUR packages even when a copy is available in cache.

       [1m--rebuildtree[0m
              When installing an AUR package  rebuild  and  reinstall  all  of  its  AUR  dependencies
              recursively,  even  the  ones  already installed. This flag allows you to easily rebuild
              packages against your current system's libraries if they have become incompatible.

       [1m--norebuild[0m
              When building packages if the package is found in cache and is an equal version  to  the
              one wanted skip the package build and use the existing package.

       [1m--mflags <flags>[0m

       [1mCONFIG DIRECTORY[0m
              The  config directory is [4m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/yay/[24m. If [1m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME [22mis unset, the config
              directory will fall back to [4m$HOME/.config/yay[24m.

              [4mconfig.json[24m Is used to store all of Yay's config options. Editing this  file  should  be
              done through Yay, using the options mentioned in [1mPERMANENT CONFIGURATION SETTINGS[22m.

       [1mCACHE DIRECTORY[0m
              The  cache  directory  is  [4m$XDG_CACHE_HOME/yay/[24m.  If [1m$XDG_CACHE_HOME [22mis unset, the cache
              directory will fall back to [4m$HOME/.cache/yay[24m.

              [4mcompletion.cache[24m holds a  list  of  of  all  packages,  including  the  AUR,  for  shell
              completion. By default the completion files are refreshed every 7 days.

              [4mvcs.json[24m  tracks  VCS  packages  and  the  latest commit of each source. If any of these
              commits change the package will be upgraded during a devel update.

       [1mBUILD DIRECTORY[0m
              Unless otherwise set this should be the same as [1mCACHE DIRECTORY[22m. This directory is  used
              to  store  downloaded  AUR  Packages as well as any source files and built packages from
              those packages.

       [1mPACMAN.CONF[0m
              Yay uses Pacman's config file to set certain pacman options either  through  go-alpm  or
              Yay itself. Options inherited include most libalpm options and pacman options.

              Notably: [1mDatabases[22m, [1mColor [22mand [1m*Path/*Dir [22moptions are used.
